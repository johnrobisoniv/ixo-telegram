"Monday, January 22, 2018",2:29:34 PM,Niels VDL,"Peter Do you have any ideas or examples in this area? One concept/example is giving them a currency allowing them to spend it on food, shelter, education etc. and helping them increase financial literacy to make their own financial decisions to invest in their own lives, instead of a bunch of grant writing & giving bureaucrats decide what is best (waterfall approach)."
"Monday, January 22, 2018",4:40:23 PM,Fennie Wang,Hey Peter! Good to see you here. It would be awesome if you guys wanted to write some guest blog posts on your various ideas on blockchain use case applications.
"Monday, January 22, 2018",6:57:53 PM,Julien,Hey everyone! First came across Ixo last week and I'm excited by the impact this could have. I am interviewing Shaun on Thursday for my show Founders in Focus. Reaching out to all of you to see if there are any burning questions you have about Ixo. Let me know and I'll include the best ones!
"Tuesday, January 23, 2018",7:10:27 AM,John,"Hi Folks. I love your project. I have been working on a concept which aims to crowdsource sustainability data about businesses, and to use that information to create a 'Trip Advisor' style listing of local businesses/organisations, with the aim of prompting a race to the top among businesses. I'd like to discuss if my project might be a use-case on your platform. The website is www.Promise2030.org."

Im from the Netherlands, (digital) product person, currently working on a local economy app in Istanbul, but also recently joined a circular economy startup based out of Amsterdam.

"Wednesday, January 24, 2018",10:57:14 PM,Fennie Wang,Thanks Niels. I still remember when we went to that cool bar in Istanbul but the streets were quiet due to some bombings earlier in the week.

I am founding a company to provide advisory services and products to assist refugees and other victims of crisis situations, with my focus now on those displaced by the conflicts in Iraq and Syria.  I am focusing on this space because I recently resigned from a position in the Office of the US Secretary of State where policy regarding these displaced people was part of my work, but I felt I could do more outside of government.  Previously, I have also worked in international development at the African Development Bank, and in credit/financial risk at Standard & Poor's and Citi.  For my place I call home, I an currently back and forth between San Salvador and Berlin, but in the coming months also plan to pass through Amman, London, NYC, DC and SFC."

"Monday, January 29, 2018",10:55:02 AM,Fennie Wang,"When you head to Berlin - I should link you up with Assem Hasna, who is a Syrian refugee living in Berlin now. He was engineering student in Damascus at time war broke out and volunteered with white helmets as a paramedic when he lost his leg in an airstrike. He learned to code, be a technician for 3D printing, working IoT development at Cisco now. I dont know if he does a lot of work on identity but certainly something to talk to him about. Check out his TEDx talk: https://m.youtube.com/watch?v=qhsnGAKI80s"
"Monday, January 29, 2018",10:56:47 AM,Lohan Spies,@FrederickSteinmann you are welcome to join the conversation. For opps for investment i suggest we take that offline. DM me

"Monday, January 29, 2018",11:20:58 AM,Lohan Spies,Great. Will respond tomorrow
"Monday, January 29, 2018",11:26:09 AM,Frederick Steinmann,Im sitting in line at the DMV in NY with my autistic son for 4 hours to get him an ID cArd. The USAs domestic identity process is quite in need of a new process as well.  The past two hours have been to pay an 8$ fee.
"Monday, January 29, 2018",11:45:29 AM,Gary de Beer,Sounds like a common problem. 4 hours is common here although that is only how long it takes after you enter the building. No accounting how long you may wait in line on the outside. :cry:
"Monday, January 29, 2018",12:22:11 PM,Steven Hatzakis,"Fred nice to see you here, these bureaucratic inefficiencies don't just cost global taxpayers billions, when waiting 4 hours to pay an $8 fee, think of how much the gov lost too - you could have been working at x $'s per hour so that is missed opportunity for them as well in terms of tax revenue and lost economic productity towards your companies! I wonder what type of social impact projects - maybe even launched on IXO - will help solve such infrastructure challenges."
"Monday, January 29, 2018",12:23:01 PM,Steven Hatzakis,"Hi everyone, nice to meet you, I am Steven Hatzakis, just wanted to say thank you also to @dafenster  for introducing me to this inspiring project."
"Monday, January 29, 2018",2:00:06 PM,Fennie Wang,"I think these initiatives need to start at local levels. Building identity ground up from local levels, digitizing government payments and according. Estonia has been doing this with e-identity and digitizing the government (although not yet hugely useful if youre not a true Estonian citizen but only e-resident). Estonia is like a million people though - its a small city in US but if we can start small on local and municipal levels, thats where things can get traction. New York City dept of social services is exploring blockchain to tackle homelessness - kind of like a decentralized Airbnb that matches private landlords providing housing to the homeless with the city compensating the landlords - could be a block of apartments or a single spare bed. Blockchain creates the trust layer between parties that dont necessarily trust each other."
"Monday, January 29, 2018",2:07:31 PM,Steven Hatzakis,"I was just thinking the same in terms of when people try to think of ways that they can create positive social impact, is to start with their local communities and indentify needs they are aware about and start there. Speaking of New York, a local gov official who has proposed several blockchain bills will be speaking at an event (I plan on going) https://tech2025.com/events/think-tank-6-ny-blockchain-legislation-and-the-creation-of-a-digital-currency-taskforce-with-assemblyman-clyde-vanel/#gettickets (and I think ID solutions like what Estonia did with their e-residency licenses is pretty cool."
"Monday, January 29, 2018",2:10:09 PM,Fennie Wang,Thanks for that! Lets go together!!

Ive spent last 6 months developing an interest in blockchain tech and become an amateur ico investor i guess. Stumbled across this project and was struck by the different focus and the potential for using this new tech in social development. Keen to follow and potentially supoort if i can"
"Monday, January 29, 2018",4:25:56 AM,Fennie Wang,"Great to have you Wyld! Thanks for your interest in us. Blockchain is also a great use case in healthcare, around records but also around recording claims for patient care and patient compliance especially in context of chronic diseases. In the US where costs are high and borne by insurance companies, they are super interested in verified/verifiable evidence of patient compliance as this literally saves billions of healthcare dollars per year. I imagine it is similar in UK but costs borne by NHS. Imagine if you can have incentives tied to evidence of patient compliance to encourage healthy behavior."
"Monday, January 29, 2018",7:02:42 AM,Shaun Conway,"Hi Martin. ixo is working together with Ocean Protocol and the X-Prize Foundation, to design an XPrize for addressing unemployment using AI and Big (Impact) Data.

"Monday, January 29, 2018",10:32:53 AM,M. Bilal,In terms of utility and productivity this IXO project is one of its own kind
"Monday, January 29, 2018",10:33:21 AM,M. Bilal,I really like the idea and if its properly implemented it can change the world we know today

It feels great to be part of this exciting project!"
"Wednesday, January 31, 2018",12:57:17 AM,Frank Frimpong,Such project is needed to help keep accurate data in the national health insurance scheme in minimizing cost and maximizing utility amongst beneficiaries
"Wednesday, January 31, 2018",1:01:01 AM,Peter Johnson,"Hi Frank, is health care the sector you are working on?  I would love to hear more about projects and ideas, as I am sure would others in this chat."
"Wednesday, January 31, 2018",1:09:07 AM,Frank Frimpong,"Yeah, I'm a researcher in health services marketing. UNICEF has expressed interested in funding health related projects adapting Blockchain Technology, and that's where I believe partnering with ixo comes in. The national health budget for the government in terms of running the NHIS is huge. That's the case problem. How about ixo innovation helping to cut costs significantly via Block chain?"
"Wednesday, January 31, 2018",1:14:47 AM,Peter Johnson,That sounds like an interesting use case to explore.  I am sure there are several people in this chat with ideas on how ixo's protocol could be applied to do this.
"Wednesday, January 31, 2018",2:31:50 AM,M. Bilal,Can someone please answer to my questions?
"Wednesday, January 31, 2018",2:34:02 AM,Tim Foster,"We are not running an ICO at the moment. We do, however, want our community to feel as involved as possible. We are working on a number of initiatives to engage the community, including meet-ups, podcasts, newsletters, AMA's. Please do let us know how you'd like to be involved in blockchain and impact."
"Wednesday, January 31, 2018",2:36:20 AM,M. Bilal,Ok goodTell me how can I help to support ixo project. I'm working as Sustainable Development Consult in Malaysia
"Wednesday, January 31, 2018",8:12:37 PM,B,hey admin! Found you guys from the dfinity rocket chat. Would be nice to have a pinned message of FAQs for newomers. 
"Wednesday, January 31, 2018",9:35:46 PM,Fennie Wang,Great suggestion! Thank you :blush:
"Wednesday, January 31, 2018",9:46:43 PM,Fennie Wang,"Ive been talking to some folks in the US about healthcare applications using ixo where healthcare costs are astronomical. Using ixo to document claims about patient behavior for good preventative care and chronic care patient compliance, which can be exchanged for financial incentives from insurance companies or the department of health. Records can be shared also with doctors and caretakers while preserving patient privacy."
"Wednesday, January 31, 2018",9:48:24 PM,Fennie Wang,Would love to learn more about your work as a sustainable Development consultant. We are working with Gold Standard Foundation on generating carbon Tokens from its clean burning cook stove projects.

We also have a very serious community on discord where we discuss projects and ideas. Happy that you like it."
"Wednesday, January 31, 2018",2:37:20 AM,Nass,As soon as I wrap my head around the whole paper I'll be asking some questions.
"Wednesday, January 31, 2018",2:58:13 AM,Joyce Zhang,"Hey ixo community! As some of you may or may not know, we recently rebranded and changed our logo. One of the new motifs in our brand is the ""Impact Tesseract"" - at ixo, we want to change the way of thinking around delivering impact, and namely, bring impact delivery into the 4th dimension with the consideration of time and duration. @MicArtus and I wrote an article about it yesterday on Medium:  https://medium.com/ixo-blog/reintroducing-ixo-8fd21dd6b537"

"Thursday, February 1, 2018",3:12:13 AM,Damian Hajda,Thanks Tim - looking forward to our first projects
"Thursday, February 1, 2018",3:12:59 AM,Damian Hajda,and very interested to hear about what everyone here is working on

"Thursday, February 1, 2018",3:15:27 AM,Bruce Good,Welcome Damian and the Social Suite team.
"Thursday, February 1, 2018",4:01:33 AM,David Gibbons,Hello team ixo & friends. Congrats on many exciting projects highlighted here.
"Thursday, February 1, 2018",4:06:24 AM,David Gibbons,Quick intro: I''m working on a project to bring equal access to legal services. Law presents an interesting opportunity in that the professional and philanthropic efforts are very well aligned. I'm keen to connect with devs and lawyers in this space. Currently looking to recruit a strong tech lead.I'm in Cape Town & met with Lohan last week - will definitely be exploring further opportunity with ixo. Cheers!
"Thursday, February 1, 2018",7:51:59 AM,AG MA,:+1:
"Thursday, February 1, 2018",8:29:22 AM,Fennie Wang,Hey David I'm a lawyer! Tell me more about your work. Just before law school many moons ago I spent 5 months in Uganda setting up an NGO to provide legal services. I was looking at land titling - but this was before anyone was talking about blockchain applications :)
"Thursday, February 1, 2018",9:27:33 AM,David Gibbons,"It's early days - the whitepaper is in mid draft - I met with Lohan last week he can give you more detail - in Law, there's a unique opportunity to directly fund an indexed input to philanthropy and the goal is different to most social good projects - justice demands you 'have' your day in court, not that you necessarily 'win'. I'm not a lawyer, I'm a start-up'er who loathes injustice. After learning the lesson the hard way, it began to fascinate me that justice should not be sought (or expected) in the law. In uneven society like ours in SA, this is exacerbated but it's obviously a global issue. We now have a tool to tackle this problem of productivity in justice - I'm pretty stoked about the opportunity."
"Thursday, February 1, 2018",6:16:26 PM,Fennie Wang,Have you looked at decentralized arbitration and dispute resolution on the blockchain?
"Friday, February 2, 2018",7:15:39 AM,David Gibbons,We don't want to do a Lawyer's job for them and it is a very 'decentralized' profession to start with - the opportunity is in doing what lawyers and law firms are not doing
"Friday, February 2, 2018",7:41:51 AM,Kevin Chen,Can I also add a couple members here as well who are interested in carbon credits? 
"Friday, February 2, 2018",7:42:41 AM,Bruce Good,Yes please.

"Friday, February 2, 2018",8:36:14 AM,Steven Hatzakis,"Kevin, nice meeting you at the Tech2025 event in NY this week and glad to see you here!"
"Friday, February 2, 2018",9:05:52 PM,Asuka Uesaka,"Hi everyone, I'm Asuka from Omise. My colleagues at OmiseGo are working hard on financial inclusion and plasma for ethereum. And I myself have engaged in nonprofits for like 8yrs as a probono. Would love to collaborate w/you guys and introduce blockchain tech to the social sector here in Japan."
"Friday, February 2, 2018",9:56:35 PM,Kevin Chen,sorry wrong chat
"Friday, February 2, 2018",9:58:05 PM,Fennie Wang,"Oh thats wonderful. Our blockchain advisor Rick Dudley was advisor to Omisego - he contributed to the white paper along with Vitalik. I might be hanging out with Joseph Poon next weekend - I havent met him yet but heard only great things about him. We are actively thinking about how to expand our presence and exposure in Asia, especially the message of social impact, which is still a relatively new idea in Asia but catching up. Id love to connect with you on how to spread the message in Asia."
"Friday, February 2, 2018",9:15:41 PM,Naoyuki Okano,"Hi all, I'm Naoyuki, a London/Tokyo based post-doc in law, joining you thanks to the introduction by Asuka Uesaka. I've been studying on land grabbing/biopiracy issues under globalization and now interested in how recent developments in tech/blockchain can solve them, or more generally will change development policies/ protection of fundamental rights. Also pumped to spread the idea of impact investments in Japan. Cheers!"
"Friday, February 2, 2018",9:16:07 PM,Miguel S,Welcome
"Friday, February 2, 2018",9:17:10 PM,Miguel S,Can you elaborate on how you would like to see development of policies and protection of rights utilizing block chain?
"Friday, February 2, 2018",9:43:29 PM,Naoyuki Okano,Hi thanks! That's difficult to say now. We legal scholars are just beginning to explore it. Obviously blockchain will make the implementation phase of development policies more effective without unnecessary costs and missing links btw goals and outcomes. But about other impacts I'll explore them in a due course
"Friday, February 2, 2018",9:44:47 PM,Miguel S,What do you think of blockchain technology in healthcare
"Friday, February 2, 2018",9:45:22 PM,Miguel S,Decentralization of medical records etc
"Friday, February 2, 2018",9:45:36 PM,Miguel S,Research clinical trials
"Friday, February 2, 2018",9:50:35 PM,Naoyuki Okano,Well though I'm not familiar but that sounds promising. Are you running any projects in healthcare?
"Friday, February 2, 2018",9:52:41 PM,Miguel S,Yes im running personal health record application for patients providing a comprehensive view of their medical records along with medical smart card. Working now with tangle network
"Friday, February 2, 2018",10:00:03 PM,Naoyuki Okano,Nice! Where are you based?
"Friday, February 2, 2018",10:00:35 PM,Miguel S,South Florida US but as know the disparity in healthcare is a global issue
"Friday, February 2, 2018",10:03:16 PM,Naoyuki Okano,Yeah definitely. Will touch base when I come across with sth relevant for you
"Friday, February 2, 2018",10:03:51 PM,Miguel S,Im also working on other projects utilizing blockchain technology
"Saturday, February 3, 2018",10:33:17 PM,Fennie Wang,"I think beyond just digitization and decentralization of the storage and data governance of medical records, whats hugely interesting is the application of blockchain in making and verifying attestations of patient behavior or patient compliance - this is super relevant in US healthcare system in incentivizing preventative healthcare behaviors that reduce medical costs. Using smart contracts, verified attestations of patient compliance and good preventive care could be linked to automatic financial incentive payments from health insurance companies."
"Saturday, February 3, 2018",10:35:06 PM,Miguel S,Well said! Thats what Im currently working on thanks the triple aim the regulations have forced healthcare providers hand to attest and meet meaningful use but patients usually go unaccounted for.
"Saturday, February 3, 2018",10:36:49 PM,Fennie Wang,Would love to learn more about your work and where ixo might be applicable.
"Saturday, February 3, 2018",10:37:27 PM,Naoyuki Okano,"Hi Fennie! Yes, I enjoyed de Soto's works as well as following discussions by, say David Kennedy, but didn't know abt his involvement in the Global Blockchain Business Council. Will check it up!"
"Saturday, February 3, 2018",10:44:50 PM,Fennie Wang,"Blockchain governance is hugely interesting area and lawyers arent even thinking about it yet. Much of blockchain design eg around consensus algorithms is really law and economics as applied to computer science. When I was in Uganda, I discovered different tribal customs and conceptions of land rights - rather than being an individualistic right as we understand in western legal tradition, land rights in certain tribal areas is communal and based on usage/utilization rather than property rights as an extension of self. Communal governance of communal property rights as managed through blockchain governance is hugely interesting and I hope you can study that!"
"Saturday, February 3, 2018",10:47:15 PM,Miguel S,Well all know the disparity in healthcare is a global issue and abundance of resources go under utilize from lack of proper data and integrity.
"Saturday, February 3, 2018",10:49:32 PM,Miguel S,Who determines usage/utilization? How are those metrics calculated.
"Saturday, February 3, 2018",10:50:23 PM,Fennie Wang,"This depends on the communities and custom. Is the land being cultivated, farmed or used as grazing??"
"Saturday, February 3, 2018",10:50:41 PM,Naoyuki Okano,"There is a young scholars' event focusing on technology and fundamental rights in Brussels and I expect it to be my first opportunity to talk about Blockchain governance, and meet people with similar interests. I'll keep you posted!http://www.philodroit.be/Brussels-Global-Law-Week-2018?lang=fr"
"Saturday, February 3, 2018",10:52:25 PM,Fennie Wang,Yes please do!
"Saturday, February 3, 2018",10:52:50 PM,Miguel S,Are those resources being utilized by community? Im trying ascertain if it stems out of a collectivist mentally or environmental stressors.
"Saturday, February 3, 2018",10:55:14 PM,Fennie Wang,"Both. If you study water rights in California and the West, where drought was frequent, youll see that its also based on usage/utility rather than pure property rights as an extension of self - and the American West is the emolument of the rugged individual!"
"Saturday, February 3, 2018",11:06:28 PM,Fennie Wang,"Well speaking of drought there is a major drought in Cape Town, where most of the ixo team is based. Tracking water usage and water sharing in contested environments is a key blockchain use case - blockchain is an ideal use case whenever a trust layer is needed amongst parties that may be adverse."
"Saturday, February 3, 2018",11:07:49 PM,Fennie Wang,"So lets say Cape Town needs to increase its water supply by tapping into ground water and not just surface water which is running out - how do you fairly allocate, track and police usage amongst competing parties in a fair and transparent way?"
"Saturday, February 3, 2018",11:08:29 PM,Fennie Wang,Block chain ledger to track water usage and allocation may be one part of solution in creating transparency and sense of fairness
"Saturday, February 3, 2018",11:09:33 PM,Miguel S,Okay I see so you can utilize the sensors in their equipment and can utilize geospatial analysis and engineering. I recently have a presentation to oil industry
"Saturday, February 3, 2018",11:12:17 PM,Fennie Wang,"Yes - IoT sensors, independent data feeds and data oracles, big data, etc are all part of the key ingredients that can feed into the ixo network in making claims and verifying claims about impact and other real world events."
"Saturday, February 3, 2018",11:17:53 PM,Miguel S,Great!
"Monday, February 5, 2018",9:05:31 AM,Joyce Zhang,"Hey ixo community! We just published our weekly update on Medium.

"Tuesday, February 6, 2018",10:56:40 PM,Fennie Wang,"Oh this looks interesting Kevin. Is this a kind of decentralized ""exchange"" for carbon assets? Or more to keep track like decentralized ""balance sheet"" of each company's environmental assets and liabilities? Do you know much about them? Curious what you think about them."

"Wednesday, February 7, 2018",4:21:39 PM,Shaun Conway,"Hi Ali. Im Shaun, the founder of ixo and a physician. Your question about how the ixo protocol could be applied in healthcare is really close to my heart. We are preparing to implement some trials of various health use-cases with industry players and a startup in the US, though still early days. One set of applications is around Claims - replacing the conventional health insurance claims mechanism with verifiable claims linked to digital identifiers. Im keen to hear more ideas and suggestions for use-cases, of which I know there will be many"
"Wednesday, February 7, 2018",4:23:33 PM,Shaun Conway,Hi Sridevi. One of the most liberating applications is personal health records that are self-sovereign and enable a health information exchange of one (user-controlled)

"Wednesday, February 7, 2018",8:07:43 AM,Sridevi Ponnazhagan,"Hi Shaun! Yes, even if the block chain technology takes one step at a time and get the prescriptions part of the EHR, there wont be any prescription drug abuse or even the opioid crisis."

"Monday, February 26, 2018",6:09:14 PM,ELi Joseph,Is Anne Connelly still a part of the founding team of this project?
"Monday, February 26, 2018",9:04:43 PM,Fennie Wang,Hi Eli - Anne left the team recently to spend more time in Toronto.
"Monday, February 26, 2018",9:51:04 PM,Gregorius,"Thanks for the update, Fennie. I'm sure she still supports Ixo & it's impact development mission. Is she continuing with work at BRI in Toronto or another startup do you know?"
"Monday, February 26, 2018",9:55:34 PM,Dallas,"thx Fennie, and How the nodes be rewarded?"
"Monday, February 26, 2018",10:37:56 PM,Fennie Wang,Node hosts will receive transaction fees from users of the ixo protocol (projects running impact claims) and the transaction fees are paid in IXO tokens.
"Monday, February 26, 2018",10:38:51 PM,ELi Joseph,"Is this an open source project, if so, will the code be available on a repository so I can look at?"
"Monday, February 26, 2018",10:39:20 PM,ELi Joseph,When is the project time for you to deliver an MVP?

"Saturday, March 3, 2018",8:49:19 AM,Glen Walsh,Very cool
"Saturday, March 3, 2018",9:50:03 AM,Fennie Wang,"The advisor to the Nigerian president on innovation joined our panel last minute. From talking to my Nigerian friends, they think the context is because the Nigerian government a few days earlier had put out a statement saying they are agnostic about blockchain and discourage use of cryptocurrencies so it was an opportunity to defend the government position."
"Saturday, March 3, 2018",9:52:21 AM,Fennie Wang,The special advisor said well blockchain is great but we have all these other problems like not even having good internet connection that we have to solve first. Nigerians in the audience challenged him on the position saying why do you want us to be left behind on blockchain and the government can see crypto as a revenue opportunity through taxes.
"Saturday, March 3, 2018",9:53:17 AM,Fennie Wang,"After the panel, the special advisor said to me, I love what ixo is doing - that could be a great thing for Nigeria. Come to Nigeria, I'll arrange a visa for you :)"
"Sunday, March 4, 2018",1:14:41 PM,Chidalu Onyenso,@dafenster great job at the panel yesterday! Would have loved to hear the NG govs view on your platform as a tool for accountability (and visibility)for the government and public/private partnerships. Hope you take up that visa offer!
"Sunday, March 4, 2018",1:21:28 PM,Fennie Wang,Thank you Chidalu! I plan to be in Cape Town around April 20 for about 3 weeks to spend some time with the team there but can take the time to visit Nigeria.
"Sunday, March 4, 2018",1:24:29 PM,Fennie Wang,Crazy thought but if anyone is interested to attend Afrikaburn it is April 23-29 outside of Cape Town. There is a blockchain camp with some guys from Parity. I've been put on the workshop and talks committee for the camp. There is also a separate telegram chat for the afrikaburn blockchain camp. I'm also thinking of organizing a post-burn decompression at the ixo offices in Cape Town.
"Sunday, March 4, 2018",1:49:01 PM,Frederick Steinmann,Crazy awesome thought!
"Sunday, March 4, 2018",2:14:58 PM,Ewa,Amazing @dafenster! I will be at the burn and in Cape Town before (beginning of April already) and afterwards. Let's meet up! And also happy to help with the organization. Could you invite me to the Telegram group?
"Sunday, March 4, 2018",3:35:05 PM,Fennie Wang,Hi @meatearth - oh wonderful!!! I'll invite you to the Afrikaburn telegram chat. We can work together on organizing some of the workshops and the post-Burn decompression with the ixo team in Cape Town.
"Sunday, March 4, 2018",3:35:50 PM,Miguel S,Was event filmed?
"Sunday, March 4, 2018",3:38:13 PM,Fennie Wang,@LxrdM - no they didn't film the event - I told the organizers they should film or live stream next time.
"Sunday, March 4, 2018",3:38:51 PM,Fennie Wang,"For an event at Duke, one of the panelists did film it on his own cam. I can share thoes links with you here."
"Sunday, March 4, 2018",3:39:25 PM,Miguel S,Okay that would be great. When is the next event? Ive been keeping up with whats going on in Nigeria and Liberia. Any thoughts on Liberia stances?

"Sunday, March 4, 2018",3:43:17 PM,Fennie Wang,"Yes - the regulators are looking to clean up the bad apples, although receiving a subpoena isn't necessarily an indication of any wrongdoing. The SEC is making fact inquiries."
"Sunday, March 4, 2018",3:43:50 PM,Miguel S,Which is well warranted. Ive noticed some wolves exploiting the sheep.
"Sunday, March 4, 2018",3:44:05 PM,Miguel S,Raising money with nothing tangible
"Sunday, March 4, 2018",3:44:10 PM,Fennie Wang,Oh yes many wolves and sharks.
"Sunday, March 4, 2018",3:44:56 PM,Fennie Wang,"But crypto will become an asset class and at ixo, we want to ensure that impact becomes an asset class!"
"Sunday, March 4, 2018",3:46:11 PM,Fennie Wang,"I was chatting with Raine Revere, the lead architect of Shapeshift Prism this morning about how we can create impact Prisms - smart contracts that mimic the value of underlying assets, and in the case of an impact prism, the underlying assets would be impact tokens generated through the ixo protocol. This would revolutionize impact investing."
"Sunday, March 4, 2018",3:47:06 PM,Frederick Steinmann,Good people
"Sunday, March 4, 2018",3:47:58 PM,Fennie Wang,Yes - Raine suggested the idea of impact prisms when we had dinner with Eric Vorhees in Denver a few weeks ago.
"Sunday, March 4, 2018",3:48:08 PM,Fennie Wang,We are thinking of starting with carbon offset assets.

"Monday, March 12, 2018",3:02:37 PM,Nick Place,Is it possible to open my own impact exchange for my hometown?
"Monday, March 12, 2018",3:28:07 PM,Fennie Wang,"Hi Nick! We are working on building the tools that would allow you to instantiate your own projects, and earn and trade impact tokens from your project based on verified impact claims. What do you have in mind for your hometown?"
"Monday, March 12, 2018",3:30:13 PM,Nick Place,"At the #ethdenver event, my team created RIPE token. I have connections with food rescue orgs throughout the front range and it would be cool to start keeping track of food that was diverted from the trash can and into hungry bellies... https://devpost.com/software/ripe-food-rescue-impact-token#updates"
"Monday, March 12, 2018",3:33:30 PM,Fennie Wang,"Oh wonderful! I dont think we had a chance to meet at ETH Denver. How far along are you guys with the dev process? We are working on technical standards for impact tokens - perhaps that can be something you guys will want to use for the RIPE token, along with the impact claim templates for recording and verifying the food that is diverted to hungry bellies."
"Monday, March 12, 2018",3:34:36 PM,Nick Place,What's your ETA on somehting usable? We're scraping the smart contracts and are at a point where we need to decide whether to integrate with ixo or start a unique exchange
"Monday, March 12, 2018",4:34:48 PM,Fennie Wang,Let me connect you with our tech team. We are getting ready to release next version of software in next few weeks. We have worked on a number of software modules/SDKs for identity and claim templates. Check out our Github: https://github.com/ixofoundation

"Tuesday, March 13, 2018",10:29:22 AM,Rochelle,Thanks Shaun! Yeah it took some work and time as I wanted to make the tech accessible to my blog readers who are excited about blockchain for social good. Thank you for sharing the article! :blush:

"Wednesday, March 14, 2018",11:56:40 AM,Frederick Steinmann,"Yes, would love that!"
"Thursday, March 15, 2018",7:17:01 AM,Paras Chopra,"Hello everyone, this is Paras fromIndia. Im a SaaS entrepreneur (founder of Wingify). Interested in using blockchain for social impact"
"Thursday, March 15, 2018",7:17:35 AM,Paras Chopra,"Nick: curious, how do you validate food rescue? Is it automated"
"Friday, March 16, 2018",10:45:00 AM,Shaun Conway,"Nick this is a great use-case for impact claims and I could see the potential to evolve evaluation oracles that will do a decent job of verifying food rescue claims, once you get more data to train the oracles."
"Friday, March 16, 2018",11:01:48 AM,Nick Place,"@drshaun Glad you think so, sending a DM"
"Friday, March 16, 2018",9:20:25 PM,Paras Chopra,Shaun - do you have more info on what structure and design of evaluation oracles? What properties make them trustworthy?
"Friday, March 16, 2018",11:36:09 PM,Gregorius,"Yes, ditto question, Paras. It holds especially if these evaluation oracles are being claimed by Shaun to just 'evolve' (oracles taking shape & structure) in the typical undirected sense of the word. Am I the only one who doesn't trust Darwinian or Dawkinsian 'evolutionary' logic here related to blockchain? It seems out of place to use this language with timestamped videos as if depicting 'biological change' with analogy to human beings and our technologies in this case were enough. The globalising logic of blockchain for 'development' (i.e. SDGs) is preferable to Western, Victorian England-style evolutionary 'struggle' motif. In any case, I'm a development rather than evolution guy when it comes to blockchain distributed ledger technology. :blush: Perhaps others feel the same about focus on development or would rather wish to defend Darwin & /or Dawkins their ability to be experts & influencers in blockchain space?"
"Saturday, March 17, 2018",12:24:32 AM,Fennie Wang,"In the context of evaluation oracles specifically - I can give a real life example that UNICEF is working on. Unicef is asked to evaluate whether schools in Kazakhstan are using the internet which believe it or not would require them to hire dudes on motorbikes to go to each school to check whether the modems are running on periodic basis. UNICEF can receive data feeds from Telefonica cell tower pings as well as some school mapping data from the government. It may also receive social media activity information from Facebook. If we use these data sources as part of our on chain evaluation audit trail, these would all be oracles and their credentials would be authenticated. UNICEF can use an algorithm to triangulate the data from these various oracles to determine whether schools in a region are using the internet, how much and how frequently."
"Saturday, March 17, 2018",12:34:41 AM,Fennie Wang,The better your data the better the evaluation algorithms.
"Saturday, March 17, 2018",12:44:53 AM,Fennie Wang,"A simple evaluation algorithm can look at patterns and discrepancies in the claims. In the case of the food rescue, it would be looking at patterns of claims from the grocer, claims from the rescuer including attachment of receipts and receipt details. These patterns can also be discerned from the metadata of these claims eg when and where these claims were made, who is making the claims, along with the substance of the claims eg quantity of food, or kinds of food donated, etc."
"Saturday, March 17, 2018",1:04:46 AM,Paras Chopra,Fantastic example of UNICEF. Im was wondering whether any theoretical / academic work has been done on this topic? I think a statistician can bring rigour to the method
"Saturday, March 17, 2018",1:20:46 AM,Shaun Conway,"All great questions and comments on the topic of Evaluation Oracles! Lets take a step back and define what we mean by an Evaluation Oracle. These fulfil an agent role in the ixo protocol. Agents can be humans, machines, DApps, algos... or groups of these in combination and/or in consensus (including BFT consensus) mechanism. A more complex example could be of a crowd forming their opinion on a claim, using a token curation staking mechanism to give their preferred algorithm higher ranking as the evaluation algo of choice. All evaluation agents in the ixo protocol have their own unique Decentralised Identifier (DID) with an associated reputation credential. Over time, reputation increases or decreases, depending on how well the agent is found to perform its function (for instance, based on number of uses, frequency of disputed claims ...). As far as evolving - we would hope that all agents (Human and Algorithmic) will learn over time, through data feedback.   @dafenster has described this quite well. When I speak about evolution, I mean this in a deterministic, Bayesian sense, where the algo gets updated with data and calibration against extrinsic references."
"Saturday, March 17, 2018",1:24:17 AM,Shaun Conway,"We will be putting our data science and research capabilities and partnerships in place, as a high priority, once we are funded. Any offers of advice, connections, referrals would be appreciated!"
"Saturday, March 17, 2018",2:35:18 AM,Paras Chopra,Also Ill be curious to know how you are thinking about updating reputation for evaluators. It brings us to the question of who polices the police :) Any system that can be gamed will be gamed. So my approach would be to refrain from crowd sourcing or algos for evaluation to start with. Let humans with reputations do it evaluation transparently and publicly. And let people debate with a human (who should be open to learn)
"Saturday, March 17, 2018",2:35:43 AM,Paras Chopra,"So in good wastages case, all videos and evaluation should be public and people can spot errors and correct them"
"Saturday, March 17, 2018",2:35:57 AM,Paras Chopra,But have someone reputable state their reputation
"Saturday, March 17, 2018",8:48:34 AM,Fennie Wang,Hi Paras! All good points - theres a few considerations and difficult problems that people are actively working to resolve: 1) privacy and 2) incentivization (while punishing bad actors) for correcting errors or for commenting on reputation
"Saturday, March 17, 2018",8:58:51 AM,Fennie Wang,"The privacy issue is a big one - you may have heard of terms like zero knowledge proofs, which refers to a technique that allows a response to a query that is limited to that query only. A classic example would be going to a bar and you need to show your ID to be 21 or older (at least in America). Instead of showing your entire ID, all the response needs to return is a yes or no to the age 21 query - not even your full birthdate (not necessary) and certainly not your height and weight and address and ID number. Ideally, answers to multiple and varied queries should not be correlated back to a single identity to preserve privacy."
"Saturday, March 17, 2018",9:02:58 AM,Fennie Wang,"Privacy is particularly important under new data privacy laws in the EU - you may have heard of GDPR in the EU which is a regulation that says individuals have rights to ask publishers of personal identifying information (PII) to remove them. GDPR wasnt written with blockchain in mind so its a nice legal mind game - if PII is published on a public blockchain that is immutable, then what happens and who is responsible (miners, developers?) and what if public keys are considered PII (because it may be possible to correlate enough info to know who those public keys belong to)?"
"Saturday, March 17, 2018",9:03:47 AM,Paras Chopra,"Agreed. Yep, privacy is a big issue here. Thanks for highlighting"
"Saturday, March 17, 2018",9:07:20 AM,Fennie Wang,"Yes, and on the incentives part - thats where applications of token curated registries are interested as these registries use token economics to incentivize stakeholders in the outcome of that registry ranking to rank honestly (gains of winning a majority outcome outweighs the gains of being bribed)."
"Saturday, March 17, 2018",9:10:09 AM,Fennie Wang,Its useful where subjective opinions matter and so far AI cannot answer - how good was the food? How adequate was the cleanup of an oil spill in a way that restored community structure and engaged community stakeholders?
"Monday, March 19, 2018",10:31:26 AM,Arturo Duran,https://www.coindesk.com/icos-iced-12-month-freeze-us-token-trading-just-beginning/amp/
"Monday, March 19, 2018",11:57:58 AM,Fennie Wang,"Ah yes - its a bit of a misleading title. What the 12 month freeze refers to is that under a Reg D security exemption, as a restricted security you cant just resell it immediately unless you are a broker dealer. So if youre not a broker dealer, Rule 144 gives you safe harbor to resell restricted securities if you hold on to them for 12 months, thereby demonstrating that you didnt buy the securities with an intent to immediately resell."
"Monday, March 19, 2018",2:34:00 PM,Arturo Duran,Thanks !!! that helps a lot
"Monday, March 19, 2018",5:25:33 PM,Fennie Wang,Theres an online blockchain summit thats free to access if you register.

My own journey has been a wild one and it is not an easy one either - but the wonderful serendipitous events and the passionate people you meet will more than make up for it. Just this week Ive had the privilege and pleasure of meeting @LxrdM and @originalcopy and in the whim of a winter storm in spring in New York, @LxrdM has graciously invited me to Miami for the weekend to speak about ixos work to his friends and colleagues."

"Thursday, March 22, 2018",5:32:18 PM,Rochelle,so true
"Thursday, March 22, 2018",9:23:20 PM,Gregorius,"As for possessive nouns, @cryptocctrader, is that Serendipity as is the character played by Salma Hayek in the film Dogma?

"Friday, March 23, 2018",1:53:29 PM,Scott Morris,+1 for the mention of the Bancor Protocol in the WP; will just casually mention I am an advisor to the Bancor Foundation
"Friday, March 23, 2018",2:20:29 PM,Fennie Wang,Hi @CSMorris - I was already thinking of bancor when you mentioned local currencies
"Friday, March 23, 2018",2:20:38 PM,Fennie Wang,Weve spoken to eyal
"Friday, March 23, 2018",2:21:38 PM,Fennie Wang,Have you looked at what city of Berkeley is doing? Bringing back the Berkeley Buck in crypto style backed by muni bonds to be spent on building affordable housing
"Friday, March 23, 2018",2:22:03 PM,Scott Morris,Now that's what I'm talking about
"Friday, March 23, 2018",2:22:16 PM,Scott Morris,"Haven't seen that yet, thanks for mentioning it"

"Friday, March 23, 2018",2:25:06 PM,Scott Morris,I'm especially interested in creating an intersection for bond backed CCs (community currencies) and what you guys call impact claims
"Friday, March 23, 2018",2:25:34 PM,Scott Morris,I spent the last year+ working on a mgmt/ partnering framework on that theme
"Friday, March 23, 2018",2:34:46 PM,Fennie Wang,Oh yes Id love to hear more. The impact claims would be for measurement of outcomes. Are the bond payments contingent on performance?
"Saturday, March 24, 2018",8:39:48 AM,Fennie Wang,Yes!! Berkeley has a special place in my heart :heart: as it is my alma mater.

Getting the university on board would be the easiest way to have distribution value for Berkeley bucks as 30,000+ students and staff could use it at dining halls (although food is disgusting from when I was there), and other university operated vendors. Imagine paying tuition in Berkeley bucks! I also wonder if the students from Blockchain at Berkeley are involved. I also know someone who is advising Berkeley about the Berkeley Bucks - thats how I knew about the project. He loves what ixo is doing."
